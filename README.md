### How to create a GitHub Page?
Note: This step-by-step will be through the use of Github Classroom
1. Accept the assignment created for you.
2. Clone the remote repository to your local machine
3. Change the visibility of your repository to public.
4. In your repository, go to Settings, then Pages. Choose "Deploy from a branch" in Source and for the Branch, choose "main" and "/(root)" then click save.
5. You can now visit your website through https://<github_classroom>/<repository_name>-<github_username>/.

### Key Takeaways
Doing this exercise is fun but it is time-consuming. I realized that I need more practice with my HTML and CSS skills to be more efficient and also to improve my web development skills. Additionally, when I was making the Projects section, I realized that I lack personal projects and I have to create more useful applications and programs to improve as a developer and also to make my portfolio shine more.
